About the job

We’re Looking Not for a Training Coordinator — but for a Learning & Impact Architect

Someone who understands how people learn, can inspire others, and turns knowledge into action. Someone who connects people, technology, and results - and moves fast.
If you have strong presence, great digital-creation skills (Canva, AI tools, etc.), and a passion for shaping how people work and learn- this is your place.

About the Role:
* Designing dynamic learning processes focused on products, services, and digital tools.
* Developing learning materials- presentations, videos, short clips, guides, and interactive tools.
* Leading organizational learning processes using strong SI skills: connection, influence, and motivating people.
* Supporting new employees, creating learning communities, and fostering a true sense of belonging.
* Identifying knowledge gaps in real time and turning insights and data into effective actions.
* Working closely with different teams and interfaces to ensure knowledge flows clearly and at the pace of the field.

What You Need to Bring:
* 1–2 years of experience delivering in-person training and leading learning processes — required.
* High proficiency in digital tools for content creation and training — required.
* Experience developing learning materials using AI tools (Gamma, Notion AI, Synthesia, Slides AI, etc.): creating content, writing scripts, designing courses, and producing videos.
* A strong advantage: understanding of digital learning and marketing.
* Ability to influence, engage, and motivate people through change.
* Systems thinking, initiative, and quick response capabilities.
* A genuine passion for people, for learning — and for achieving results.
