Content Creation: Produce high-quality, engaging educational assets, including:
Self-paced video courses and interactive modules.
Sandbox exercises and deep-dive workshops.
"Trial learning packs" to support Sales-Led Trials (SLT).

Readiness Programs: Create mandatory readiness certifications and knowledge refresh cycles for every major product release to ensure global consistency.
 Community & Revenue Growth
Community Integration: Gamify learning through badges and ranks, and foster peer-to-peer learning.
Revenue Generation: Develop and launch paid certification programs and advanced instructor-led bootcamps to create a new revenue channel.

Requirements:

3+ years of experience in Instructional Design, Learning & Development, or Customer Education in a SaaS environment.
Proven experience selecting, implementing, and managing an LMS.
Strong proficiency in content creation tools.
Experience building certification programs from scratch is a huge plus.
Ability to translate complex technical concepts (ITSM, automation, asset management, AI) into accessible, engaging learning experiences.
Strategic mindset: You can connect educational initiatives to business KPIs like MRR, adoption, and support ticket reduction.

Why Join Us?

Impact: You will be building a "strategic growth engine" from the ground up that directly impacts revenue and customer retention.
Ownership: You will have the autonomy to shape the vision of the SysAid Customer Academy.

Growth: As the Academy expands to include AI-driven learning and enterprise packages, your role and influence will grow with it.
